Hey Michele
sorry about the length but it is a long story..


so you should see two apps in my folder.
the reason for that is that i was working for a long time on my genuine idea, with some small changes.
the idea is taking some photos automatically in a certain pace.
the user determines in which pace and for how long to take pictures, and when to start.
the app takes the pictures and stores them in a database in groups.
the gallery presents the photos, without seperation between groups for now.

at some point I found out that appinventor doesn't let the app really take pictures by itself.
then you showed me (thanks) "takepicture", an external library that once is called (using an activityStarter)
takes a picture and then returns it to the app in the "afterActivity" block.

http://puravidaapps.com/takepicture.php - the explanations and examples of "takepicture".
https://code.google.com/p/puravidaapps/downloads/detail?name=takepicture.apk for downloading its .apk.

(i was working with the phone i loned from Meet).

when i got to the step of running the app, takePicture crashed time after time.
i made sure it wasn't a problem with my code by trying out the developer's "takepicture test" app,
in which takepicture crashed as well every couple of photos it took.

bumbed though determined i sat and decided i don't want to hand in a bad project.
so i sat for some hours at night and built a new project.
the new project is a Tic-Tac-Tow game that you play against a friend,
in which you can take pictures of yourselves and set them as X and O.
(these photos will appear on the board of the game).
they are saved in a database and loaded automatically once opening the app.
only one pair of photos is saved at each time.
changing the photos is only possible when not playing.
when the game is over the result is presented. a "reset" button lets you start a new game at any moment.
(i've finished the app that night.)

this game may contain a bit less features but it did take some thinking and a bunch of code.


Today (Sunday 22nd) i tried my old app once again, this time on my louzy slow old android,
which has the android version 2.something
it worked. "takepicture" did not crush on my phone.
i looked again at the webpage of "takepicture" and it said that they checked it on android 2 and 3.
so i assume that it not working with the Meet phone, which has the android version 4.something,
because it's not compatible with android 4.

so anyway i went back and worked on the genuine idea (remember that it was today, december 22nd).
after a long night of some more work i managed to finish it.

both apps aren't so pretty, but that's it for now:)

i know you probably think i shoudld've worked on it earlier, and i agree, but i did work on it for many hours even before i got stuck,
and the last few weeks were crazy, especially because of school pressure.

sorry again for the length :O   and thanks for the help.
I hope you'll find some android 3 or 2 to check out my camera-app, there should'nt be a problem with the Tic-Tac-Toe.
i put more work to this, obviously, as this is my original idea.
if you won't find such device (consider temporary downgrading), i can bring mine.
remember that the camera app ("PhotoMatic") has to have "takepicture" installed (the link is up).

(i've sent you an email about all the files which includes them)
