I am super proud of BOTH of your projects! I can’t believe you did both, since both are extremely high quality. For PhotoMatic, not only do I love the idea, but I also love that you were able to figure out a way to make it work - that’s exactly the kind of entrepreneurial, do-it-yourself attitude that I had hoped to see. It didn’t work perfectly on my Android 4, but it took two pictures. I can imagine that it works better in a lower version of Android - I’ll ask to see it next time I see you. 

The thing I like best is that the interface is really clean. I can immediately tell what is happening, what I should do, and what the point of the app is. The only suggestion I have for the PhotoMatic app is in the interface to try and include a “countdown” for when the next picture will be taken. You have one for when the FIRST picture will be taken, but not for when the last picture will be taken. 

I am really excited about your apps - they are very well-designed, and from your blocks editor screenshots, your code is organized nicely. I am also really glad that you did not give up when something didn’t work in your app; you kept trying to find it. Excellent work.
